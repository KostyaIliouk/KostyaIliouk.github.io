    task1: Maintained and edited high profile reports - such as the Earnings Release, Report to Shareholders, etc. - ensuring proper governance is being followed.

This solution saved our internal client 260 hours annually - in turn attracting other internal clients to a total time savings of over 600 hours annually if adopted.
