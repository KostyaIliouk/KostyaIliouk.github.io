title: Hack This Site - Basic 2
---

Welcome back to my walkthrough of hackthissite.org's CTF missions. I will be going through my thought process of how I solved these missions, and therefore also giving away the solutions. If you came across this to give you hints, watch out for spoilers! Good luck, have fun.

Similarly to the previous mission, we have a password that we are meant to discover and enter in order to continue to the following mission. The hint that is given to us is that Sam neglected to upload the password file.

Well, if there is no password file...there is no password right? So what happens when we simply press submit? Voila! The second mission has been complete.
