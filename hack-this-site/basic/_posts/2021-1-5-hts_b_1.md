title: Hack This Site - Basic 1
---

Welcome to my walkthrough of hackthissite.org's CTF missions. I will be going through my thought process of how I solved these missions, and therefore also giving away the solutions. If you came across this to give you hints, watch out for spoilers! Good luck, have fun.

We are presented with a password form with a submit button. Our hint is to learn HTML. So I will instantly checkout the HTML code of this webpage. Using the inspect tool will quickly take me to the desired element - the password form.

Conveniently, the password can be found in a comment directly above the element wrapping the form. Simply copy paste from the comment to the form and voila! First challenge complete.
