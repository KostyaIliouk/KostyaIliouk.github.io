title: Hack This Site - Programming - Reverse Encryption
---

Welcome back to my walkthrough of hackthissite.org's CTF missions. I will be going through my thought process of how I solved these missions, and therefore also giving away the solutions. If you came across this to give you hints, watch out for spoilers! Good luck, have fun.

This mission gives us 120 seconds to return the last serial number that has been encrypted using the shown PHP script. 

The code snip below is the source code that I wrote to complete this challenge, written in python. Writing this code was a lot of fun and I would greatly suggest any reader to try and complete this mission for themselves. I decided to take a greedy approach using recursion in order to find the solution - as it was the approach that made the most sense to me. There is a more 'naive' way that one could complete this mission, and that is to try and compute all permutations of an MD5 hash and attempt to decrypt the ciphertext with each permutation. This is 'naive' as it is not the most optimal solution and would take a considerable more time in order to complete. The code is well commented and is hopefully self-explanitory in what it does.
