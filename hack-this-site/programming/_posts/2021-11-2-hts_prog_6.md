title: Hack This Site - Programming - Bypass the image captcha
---

Welcome back to my walkthrough of hackthissite.org's CTF missions. I will be going through my thought process of how I solved these missions, and therefore also giving away the solutions. If you came across this to give you hints, watch out for spoilers! Good luck, have fun.

This mission has given me many issues throughout my completion. In the end, I was still not able to get a successful submission rate anywhere near where I would have liked it to be, but I did not want to spend anymore time on it. I had successfully 'completed' the mission after 28 submitted entries, with an overall 6.9% success rate within those 28 submissions. The issues that caused this low success rate were that a single `0` would be interpreted as a `D` or a single `B` would get interpreted as a `8`. This success rate could have been increased if I had more training data for these particular characters. The following explains my process of completing this challenge.

I had decided to use a couple of libraries to help me with this mission. Specifically the following python modules: PIL, math, and pytesseract - with Tesseract as a dependency. Furthermore, I had to train the `eng.traineddata` file to create my own language file called `hts-p6-eng.traineddata`.

The following code is what I had come up with to solve this challenge. Originally it had a success rate of 2% for a given set of 15 characters. Once training with 506 annotated character images, it had evolved to a 6.9% success rate amongst a given set of 253 characters.

I had used the following resources to find the most accurate config options prior to data training:
- [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9632044/tesseract-does-not-recognize-single-characters)
- [pyimagesearch.com](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/17/opencv-ocr-and-text-recognition-with-tesseract/)

It was after testing that I had realized that I would never get anywhere without training for the specific font that that is generated by this mission. I had then used the following resource, whilst having to edit a lot of the code that was made available, in order to train the `eng.traineddata` file.

This one was really rough, but we move onto the next.
