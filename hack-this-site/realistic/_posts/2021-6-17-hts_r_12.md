title: Hack This Site - Realistic - Heartland School District
---

Welcome back to my walkthrough of hackthissite.org's CTF missions. I will be going through my thought process of how I solved these missions, and therefore also giving away the solutions. If you came across this to give you hints, watch out for spoilers! Good luck, have fun.

Our next realistic mission asks us to hack into the school district server of our client and clear the list of blocked sites that students could access by breaching their admin portal.

As always, I will begin to approach this mission with a simple evaluation of how the frontend works. I will try to visit all accessible pages through the website and try to find anything that is interesting. The frist thing that you notice is the following call stack when trying to acces the path `/`:

<div class="container col">
    <figure class="text-center">
        <img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/blogposts/hackthissite/r12/initial-call-stack.svg" alt="Inital entry redirects to /cgi-bin/internet.pl which returns a page with an <iframe> that calls /cgi-bin/page.pl that redirects to ../main.html">
        <figcaption>
            Demonstrates the call flow of the inital connection to the website.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

At the top of the webpage we can see a form that asks us to complete the URL of a page that we wish to access.
