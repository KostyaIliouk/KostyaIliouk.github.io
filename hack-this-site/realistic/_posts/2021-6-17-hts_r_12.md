title: Hack This Site - Realistic - Heartland School District
---

Welcome back to my walkthrough of hackthissite.org's CTF missions. I will be going through my thought process of how I solved these missions, and therefore also giving away the solutions. If you came across this to give you hints, watch out for spoilers! Good luck, have fun.

Our next realistic mission asks us to hack into the school district server of our client and clear the list of blocked sites that students could access by breaching their admin portal.
