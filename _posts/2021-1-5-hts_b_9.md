title: Hack This Site - Basic 9
topic: Hack This Site
---

Welcome back to my walkthrough of hackthissite.org's CTF missions. I will be going through my thought process of how I solved these missions, and therefore also giving away the solutions. If you came across this to give you hints, watch out for spoilers! Good luck, have fun.

Similarly to the previous challenges we must discover a password to continue to the following challenge. Our hint is that Sam has saved the unencrypted password in some obscured file in the current directory (/missions/basic/9/). It also says that there is a way to get the obscured level 9 password through the previous mission. Lastly, it says the the script (that the creators of the website have implemented to reduce users seeing their entire file structure) finds the first occurance of `<!--` and looks to see what follows directly after.
