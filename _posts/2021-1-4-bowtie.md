title: How Does the Internet Look Like?
topic: Random
---

The landing page of this website has a little confusing line : `Welcome ... to my own slice of the bowtie that is the World Wide Web`. If I were you, the first thing that would come to my mind is "Bowtie? What is this guy talking about?". Well hopefully by the end of this blogpost we will be on the same page and understand the cleverness of this line.

<!-- Before diving into the nitty gritty, I want to define a couple key distinct words that I will be using many times, and what i mean by those words. -->

To begin with, we shall explore the idea that the Web, meaning web pages on the World Wide Web, can be thought of as a graph. It is evident, I hope, that the underlying infrastructure of what we know as the Internet can be easily represented as a graph, where nodes represent hosts (s.a. switches/bridges, servers, firewalls, etc.), and edges are represented by links between these hosts (s.a. ethernet, wireless, etc.). But how would one represent the Web? Well, the intuitive approach would be to have any page that is hosted on the Web as a node, and hyperlinks between pages as edges. In doing so, we can start to build a graph between Web pages. To demonstrate this idea, the image below shows what this website would look like as a graph.

Now it is evident that the image above is just a rough representation, although the message is brought across quite clearly. Now, I personally know that my github page links to my website, and therefore, we would have an incoming edge from my github profile to my website. Following this outlined procedure, we would be able to construct a graph representation of the entire World Wide Web. Sadly, it would be way to complex for anyone to understand and be able to retain any useful information. So what does this have anything to do with a bowtie? To get to this part, we need to define - or review - a couple basic graph theory definitions.

Firstly, we will define what is a `directed graph`. To put it simply, a directred graph is a graph where the edges have direction. We can also describe this by saying, for any given node v, `In(v) = {w | w can reach v}` and `Out(v) = {w | v can reach w}`. This way, we can described to whom a certain node is connected to and note that whilst node v can reach w, w cannot reach v. The following image shows an example of a directed graph where Out(A)={B, C, D}, but In(A)={B, C}.

Evidently, the World Wide Web graph representation, as we previously described it, is a directed graph. Now in order to further simplify the mess that is our current representation, we need to define two types of directed graphs `Strongly Connected` and `Directed Acyclic Graph`. A strongly connected directed graph can be easily described as a graph such that for all nodes v within the graph, In(v)=Out(v).
