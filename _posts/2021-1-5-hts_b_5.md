Welcome back to my walkthrough of hackthissite.org's CTF missions. I will be going through my thought process of how I solved these missions, and therefore also giving away the solutions. If you came across this to give you hints, watch out for spoilers! Good luck, have fun.

Similarly to the previous challenges we must discover a password to continue to the following challenge. Our hint is that Sam hardcoded the password into the script that checks the password entered. Thankfully, Sam also added a script onto this webpage that would send him this password with a press of a button! Sadly, this time he made the email program more secure.

Inspecting the email button i see that the hidden to input is still there, so lets try the same approach as last time and enter our email and press the button. Seems like it sent us another email with a new password. Lets see what happens when we try to use this password. Voila! We have completed this mission as well.... Not too sure what was so different about this challenge against the previous one... Maybe I just missed something.
